0.0.13:
      Added missing file EnterKey.java

0.0.12:
      Added "I press the enter button" step

0.0.11:
      Added a small delay after executing cucumber from calabash-android-run
      to make termination prettier.

0.0.10:
      Added -v and --verbose options to calabash-android run.
      This will turn on verbose logging for Calabash as well as Cucumber.
      Default logging is much less verbose now but can be even better.
0.0.9:
      Moved from Robotium 2.5 to 3.2.1
0.0.8:
      Added colors to Cucumber output

0.0.7: Output from the ant build and from running Cucumber is now in sync.
       That means that you can now trust that the output you see is actually
       the most recent output from ant or Cucumber.
